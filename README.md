# TestConsoleWindow
This is test console window for unity 5 .

And most function is done by garry.
Here is where i found it.http://garry.tv/2014/04/23/unity-batchmode-console/

And this test project is very simple ,put button A down ,you can show the test word.
But more than that ,it can change the freamwork for you ,because in  the ConsoleInput.cs, 
Console itself use most of function in Framework 4.0, and the unity 5 just support 3.5 when you change the compile option in
.Net 2.0ã€‚

So what i have done for u ,is simple for everyone to use the console window and input function.

here is the test blog:http://blog.csdn.net/cartzhang/article/details/49884507

thanks to you all.
